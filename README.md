## How It Works

The extension uses the [OpenHands Cloud API](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/cloud/cloud-api) to start new conversations. When you click the "Launch with OpenHands" button or select an option from the dropdown:

1. For repositories:
   - Default action: Starts a general conversation with the repository context
   - "Learn about this codebase": Starts a conversation focused on understanding the repository structure
   - "Add a repo.md microagent": Starts a conversation to help create a repo.md file
   - "Add setup.sh": Starts a conversation to help create a setup.sh script

2. For pull requests:
   - Default action: Starts a conversation with instructions to check out the PR branch, read the git diff, and understand the purpose of the PR
   - "Fix failing GitHub actions": Starts a conversation focused on fixing CI/CD issues
   - "Resolve merge conflicts": Starts a conversation focused on resolving merge conflicts
   - "Address code review feedback": Starts a conversation focused on addressing review comments

3. For issues:
   - Default action: Starts a conversation to investigate the issue
   - "Investigate Issue #123": Starts a conversation to analyze the issue and suggest approaches
   - "Solve Issue #123": Starts a conversation to implement a solution for the issue

The extension intelligently detects the context (repository, PR, or issue) and shows only relevant options in the dropdown menu.
